# Module 1
git and gitHub

GitHub is a distributed version control system that is designed to track changes over multiple users and versions,
and allows a team to merge individual efforts and edits to current code.

You always push up to GitHub and pull down from GitHub to your local device

## Notable commmands:
### Basic Configuration (Used once on a device to set up connection)
git config --global user.name "Your username"
git config --global user.email "yourmail@example.com"

### Creating a repo:
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/repository-name.git
git branch -m main
git add .         (use "." for all files, or filename)
